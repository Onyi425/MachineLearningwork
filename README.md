The project is aimed at building a machine learning model using the classification algorithm for supervised learning to check the body mass index of 500 persons based on the selected data and compare the best accuracy using decision tree and random forest classifier.
The entire process starts by gathering the data from a preferred source, then we went ahead to pre process the data in order to be used for the machine learning model. Next we chose a model based on the problem we were trying to solve, based on that, i chose to use the classification algorithm. i went on to train the model and test it, in order to minimise errors in the training process. Next was to tune the model, change parameters, re train the model until the best accuracy was achieved, majorly an iterative process. in this case, i compared both decision tree and random forest classifier and realised that the random forest classifier gave a better accuracy of 93% in the model, which was a near perfect one.
